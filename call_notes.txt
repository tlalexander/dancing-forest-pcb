microcontroller
accelerometer
power supply system - LED voltage
5050 packaged WS2812 - maybe top and side emitting? batteries physically above the board, light emits down and sideward
batteries - level shifters?
wifi interface
usb interface
removable and replacable batteries
voltage measurement
special board shape

power switch?

all one board, or separate LEDs and micro board?

do some battery life calculations

do we want white light emitted?

could use VL53L0X sensors to detect people walking by

access point could host a web interface for a cell phone app - or some way to interface with a cell phone
raspberry pi host


tens of devices with bidirectional communications
server is aware of accelerometer data

wifi with a separate access point

2023 NOTES:

Add quiik

TODO:
(* means not done, make sure to check)
(- means done)
- Shut off LEDs - N channel MOSFET to ground
- how do we program it? dev boards use USB serial. at a minumum break out USB serial.
- confirm method of programming.
- Add quiik
- add bulk capacitance for board
- add springs to battery placement.
- add backup pads or connector holes for USB
- change the ESP32 to the ESP32-WROOM-32E-N8 C701342
- add connector to external LEDs
- add USB UART chip

add multimeter touch points for power measurement (note: ended up just adding power sense circuit. also I am not sure exactly what touch points we would add for this).
think and care about the ground plane
make sure to notch distance sensors

* Confirm LED supply voltages works with LIPO
* sam will recalculate battery capacity
* Sam will quadruple check board dimensions, LED radius, LED count
* double check I2C pins
* confirm Molex KK 254 is a good match for neopixel connectors

spring contacts C3015090
add some test points!
is this the correct ESP32? C701341

is this a good SK6812? C5181320

Must have chips:
ESP32
- Serial chip - pinout and wiring
- 3.3v regulator
- current measurement chip
- mosfets for LED power
- WS2812B - 3.7-5.3v
- SK6812 - 3.7-5.5v
- SK6812-SIDE - 3.7v-5.5v
CONFIRM ALL LED VOLTAGES
- Gyro footprint looks okay
CONFIRM GYRO INT1 INT2 PINS
ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8
C2913206
